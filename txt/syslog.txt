Message            : The Kerberos client received a KRB_AP_ERR_MODIFIED error

                     HOST/SRVDAG2016.duoc.cl. This indicates that the target 
                     server failed to decrypt the ticket provided by the 
                     client. This can occur when the target server principal 
                     name (SPN) is registered on an account other than the

                     target SPN is only registered on the account used by the 
                     server. This error can also happen if the target service 
                     account password is different than what is configured on 
                     the Kerberos Key Distribution Center for that target 
                     service. Ensure that the service on the server and the 
                     KDC are both configured to use the same password. If the 
                     server name is not fully qualified, and the target domain 
                     (DUOC.CL) is different from the client domain (DUOC.CL), 
                     check if there are identically named server accounts in 
                     these two domains, or use the fully-qualified name to 
                     identify the server.

Message            : The Kerberos client received a KRB_AP_ERR_MODIFIED error 
                     from the server dc-admprimario$. The target name used was 
                     cifs/DC-ADMPRIMARIO.duoc.cl. This indicates that the 
                     target server failed to decrypt the ticket provided by 
                     the client. This can occur when the target server 
                     principal name (SPN) is registered on an account other 
                     than the account the target service is using. Ensure that 
                     the target SPN is only registered on the account used by 
                     the server. This error can also happen if the target 
                     service account password is different than what is 
                     configured on the Kerberos Key Distribution Center for 
                     that target service. Ensure that the service on the 
                     server and the KDC are both configured to use the same 
                     password. If the server name is not fully qualified, and 
                     the target domain (DUOC.CL) is different from the client 
                     domain (DUOC.CL), check if there are identically named 
                     server accounts in these two domains, or use the 
                     fully-qualified name to identify the server.
